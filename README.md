# "Crazy Rich Asians is the Asian Black Panther": Representation, Terrible Takes, and the Foibles Of A Search String
## Why
My twarc search string for the tweet dataset was, besides all the terrible cishet Asian-American Men's Rights Activists that haunt Asian-American twitter, one of the single worst takes that I have seen recently that came from Asian (and Asian-American twitter): "Crazy Rich Asians is the Asian Black Panther." This was an objectively terrible take for several reasons: first, it is extremely anti-black to diminish the importance of Black Panther as a black cultural milestone, and this is especially egregious because there is already a major problem with anti-blackness in Asian and Asian-American communities.  In addition, they are not at all the same genre of movie, and thematically are opposites: Black Panther is a pan-African anti-colonialist fantasy of an African country that escaped imperialism and was never colonized, that had social commentary as integral along with the superhero action. Crazy Rich Asians is peak Colonialist fantasy: Singapore is a nation founded on colonialism and imperialism and all the main characters' families became rich through complicity with that colonial system, taking advantage of it. It is also a romantic comedy with very little, if any, in the way of social commentary. Second, while Crazy Rich Asians is extremely accurate to the lives of the .05% in Singapore, the very richest of the Chinese families who are at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy (at least according to commentary that I've seen on twitter), it elides the reality of Singapore, such as non-extremely wealthy Chinese families, Indians, and Malays, as well as the existence and experiences of Filipino domestic workers like my cousin Afril,  exploited by the wealthy families that they work for.  

## How
Surprisingly, given the amount of arguing I saw regarding the validity and correctness of that take, my dataset was very small when I finally scraped it, consisting only of thirty-six tweets, many of which were retweets. I was initially quite confused, as I remembered seeing quite a lot of debate on my twitter feed, and had expected more, before I sat down and considered the reasons why (in addition to the possibility that I had misremembered the timing of the most recent trailer release, when the most recent wave of criticism and reaction occurred)  first, given the vehemence of the arguing and the high likelihood of trolls, especially given the number of Asian-American MRA trolls that already existed in the digital space of Asian-American twitter, there was likely a wave of people locking their accounts to protect themselves. Second, while my account has access to several locked twitter feeds, the test key for configuring twarc was not generated with my account, but Ed's: it is extremely likely, then, that the tweet scraper tool did not have access to the locked accounts on my feed. Third, I used a very specific search phrase, quoting the original bad opinion and did not take into account that much of the discourse that I saw did not use that phrasing, subtweeting and critiquing the original poster without ever once using the "Crazy Rich Asians is the Asian Black Panther" quote.   All the results I got were also in English: partially because Crazy Rich Asians  is an English-language movie and mostly because I searched in English: if I had the ability to search in other languages, my search results would be much more varied, including discourse that is not in English. 

NVivo would not likely be helpful unless I can figure out a search term that is much more encompassing of the actual discourse surrounding that bad take about Crazy Rich Asians: my current sample size is so small that it would make no difference.  The one useful story that I can tell with my data, besides the confirmation that all those tweets are in English, is the time zone of the posters: most of them were concentrated in the Eastern US timezone, with a few scattered elsewhere, including one in Singapore.   I'm not sure how much digital redlining would affect my data, given the unusually small sample size, but I would not be surprised if there was a heavy bias towards East Asian attitudes on the movie, given the subjects of said film, with Brown Asian tweets pushed down (and out). 

I'm not certain that there are very many ethical issues with me possessing this data, besides the inherent problems with me scraping (public) Tweets without asking or contacting any of the authors, as this is critique of a movie: it isn't high-stakes, and it isn't something that could get someone legally in trouble (such as protesting a state institution).
